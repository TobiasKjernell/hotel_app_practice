React Query 
------------

powerful lib for managing remote (server) states.

data is cached (stored), which means if component A is fetching 'cars' 
react Query will store it and if component b is fetching 'cars' later, it will
take the stored info from react query instead of fetching from server.
In this case, component b will get a instant feedback on information.

automatic error and loading states

automatic re-fetching to keep state synched

pre-fetching (ex: 2 different pages, we have info for the 'other' page already)

offline support

Example call:
const x = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['cabin'],
    queryFn: getCabins
  })
